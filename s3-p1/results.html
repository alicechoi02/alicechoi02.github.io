    Thank you for participating! I am unfortunately not there to see where this activity goes, but in my hopes the results above show some sort of a difference amongst the two groups. 
    To explain what just happened: upon scanning the QR code, each of you were brought to a website whereby you had a 50:50 chance of getting an AI generated soundtrack that was either
    exciting EDM dance music or a soothing medidation sound.

    With this project, I wanted to see how I could take the fact that I wasn't going to be there to deliver the instructions as my own design challenge and figure out how I could use code
    to do the direction-giving instead. I included the results of the feelings above for contrast, but the "success" of this performance is one that I can't predict or even see because I won't be there; 
    as the "director" the only thing I can do is set the stage for you, the "performers." I hope you enjoyed the ~3 minute getaway that the soundtrack may have provided. I can't wait to see
    how this performance plays out!
