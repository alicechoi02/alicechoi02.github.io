            <p>This project is a WEB RING that connects all students’ web
                publications from Section 1 together. We looked at
                discovering a modular code that could be implemented within
                each student’s project, while also preserving the character
                of each student’s design.

            <p>For the final project of this section, we created a 
                browser-based design that creatively employed the 
                system's clock with p5.js. The approach taken here was
                to figure out how to extract the metaphor of a clock to
                visually represent the passage of time.

            <p>For the final project of this section, we created an
                online publication that employed a consistent visual
                style across pages. This was a good opportunity to think

            <p>This project required a team of 2 or 3 students to come up 
                with a visual system that would communicate each group’s 
                image of choice. Our group created a gallery of fruits using

            <p class = "read">Of the reading, I was drawn mostly to the example of John Murphy's 
                "Selected Works" because I thought it did a good job at contextualizing 
                the author's descriptions of how a book is consisted of everything and 
                nothing at the same time. Each page holds meaning in its contextual relationship 
                to the rest of the book, and at the same time, each page means nothing on its 
                own. In reference to this specific example, I personally would disagree with the author's 
                comment at the end about how, if one were to take the content out of a book and place it in 
                a gallery-like format, it would lose its authentic rhythm. While the reading rhythm 
                may change, I do not think that is necessarily a negative thing.

            <p class = "read">This was a very insightful read in that it pushed me to think about the 
                notions of design past what is simply seen. While I do not have the technical background 
                to have understood the entirety of the systematic descriptions Eve was providing, I was 
                able to take away from this reading the chance to realize the extent to which information 
                must be organized behind the scenes in order for a pleasant, secure, and efficient experience.

            <p class = "read">This reading evoked many fruitful thoughts/questions, and I thought 
                it was especially appropriate given the context of the class. I understood the 
                concern that a website is now defined more by its capabilities than its 
                technical composition. Additionally, I appreciated the description of a website 
                being like a feedback loop — an artist must be mindful of the input and output of their work. 
                Finally, I was left with the question of waste in the digital space: is there any harm in continuously “throwing rocks into the ocean”?

            <p class = "read"> Multiple phrases in the first few sections of this text I read stood out to me. 
                The first one was a consideration of graphic design as a manipulation or signal for the 
                slippery nature of meaning. I interpreted this as an opportunity for design to be the 
                ay in which the designer themselves defines and therefore delivers meaning to their audience. 
                Finally, I enjoyed the remark made about how "the computer proves to be both the fatal contradiction 
                and the enabling technology of post-modernism" during the discussion of how no matter how rebellious 
                a designer tries to be about creating a typeface, they will be faced with the irony that their 
                letters will appear the same way every time it is typed. To me, this dilemma is the essence of post-modernism design.

            <p class = "read"> This reading was a good opportunity for me to better understand alt-text — 
                a concept that I had only heard of, but never truly understood — and also think about its 
                implications. I was fascinated by the question of: how we describe an image to a person with visual 
                impairment, and is "sight" of that image their greatest priority? In answering this, the 
                conversation in the text about alt-text as poetry was helpful in considering how an artist 
                might go about describing their images; instead of taking on the pressure of accurately describing 
                a work in just a few sentences, to think about that space as another form of art might provide a 
                more meaningful interaction with people who have visual impairments.

            <p class = "read"> I found the concept of "publicness" interesting, specifically in Price's Dispersion, when 
                they mention that "the problem with situation a work in a singular point in space and time is that it 
                turns it into a monument." When an artist then decides to make their work "public" and open on say a digital 
                platform whereby "surfaces" reproduce themselves indefinitely, I think it is interesting to consider
                 how the value of that work no longer becomes a singular entity, but rather determined by the collective experience. 
                 My question then is, how much of this collective experience is the designer responsible for?

                 experience, including the in-between moments." I think this is particularly interesting in today's understanding and 
                 application of design in that the "in-between" can mean so many things beyond negative space in a 2D sphere. 
                 For example, this could be a simple loading page after you've inputted your username and password, it could 
                 be the character selection page when before you start a game etc... I
                 n response to this I began to think about how I might be able to design an experience that pays attention to such details 
                 and also appropriately accounts for the brains ability to automatically expect/fill in the in-betweens, as explained by, say, the "running man pixel" in the text.

                out to me was "computer literacy." The rest of the section goes on to discuss the 
                educational context and application of technological (un)bias, but I couldn't help but fixate 
                on the irony of the newfound expectation that, in order to supposedly reach one's greatest educational 
                potential, one must first learn a whole new language first: the computer. I began to wonder whether something could really 
                be considered a tool if it is (a) not accessible/inclusive to all and (b) if it requires an entirely separate and complex set of knowledge to operate.

                I thought to be as a rather "modern" style of drawing, with the story itself, which I thought had somewhat of an overly dramatic tone, 
                almost made the narrative feel satirical. However, reading it I knew everything that was being visualized and said were in fact reality, 
                and so grappling with how I might fully understand and interpret the irony of the text as a whole is something I think I'd continue to think about. 
                Finally, I wanted to highlight a specific quote that really caught my eye: "“You can’t fix the computer just like you can’t turn back

                This week's readings, particularly the Steyerl piece, offered a new perspective into thinking about computers, their functionality

                proximity but when I took a step back to think about it, I was unsure of what direction exactly I was heading. I think the most 
                interesting yet complex idea was that of rationality. Can rational behavior be expected? If, as Steyerl states, the only true 
                rationality is actually a man-made, artifical computer, is that in fact rational? Does that lend rationality to the man who made it

                charge of their “aesthetic potency.” The ultimate goal of an environment is to guide the users to see themselves in that environment, by 
                encouraging participation and exploration. The rest of the text goes on to talk more about – what I understood as technical, but as the
                author delineates as colloquial – terms to describe the hierarchy of programs, motions and visible states to achieve this goal. 
                However, I am choosing to get caught up in the word “potency.” Reading this word posed so many questions to me: how do I exercise 
                power in my style, in my voice as an artist? What does it mean to be, perhaps, aesthetically subtle?

            <h3 style = "font-size: 2.5vh"> <i>Boris Groys - Art on the Internet & Christine T. Wolfe - Computing in Crip Time from Logic Issue 16 Clouds</i></h3>
            <p class = "read"> Right off the bat, I was really drawn into the first few sentences of Wolfe's  text: "I no longer just move through space,
                 I spend time here." I appreciate how the author, in speaking naturally about their own experiences, allowed me to take a step back 
                 from the flow of time and also consider the fleeting moments the author was delineating. While the author and I have different backgrounds, 
                 the discussion of time, productivity, and flow are all things that we can relate to in the current day and age, as the author themselves 
                 mentioned in the text, too. In considering how this text might inform us as designers, I wonder whether this cycle of "productivity" is 
                 something users are looking to break. In other words, is it my responsibility as a designer to provide an escape from this, because if so, 
                 how can I do it right such that it is a worthy distraction/detour from seamless workflow?

            <h3 style = "font-size: 2.5vh"> <i>Alyssa Battistoni - A Repair Manual for Spaceship Earth from Logic Issue 9 Nature & Wendy Hui Kyong Chun - On Software or the Persistence of Visual Knowledge</i></h3>
            <p class = "read"> I respond to multiple aspects of this week's readings. Firstly, I am intrigued by the idea of a biosphere and the idea of 
                finding a "substitute" for Earth entirely. In one of my other classes, we had a lengthly discussion on biological design as well as 
                biomimicry, and how there is a lot of opportunity to take from our natural environment to inform self-reproducing design; I wonder whether
                 this idea of substitution/biosphere challenges or supports such existing notions. Additionally, I resonate specifically with one 
                 line from Chun's text, where they mention "software also produces users through benign interactions."

            <h2> Week 16</h2>
            <h3 style = "font-size: 2.5vh"> <i>Donella Meadows & John Richardson & Gerhart Bruckmann - Groping in the Dark</i></h3>
            <p class = "read"> To note a few points that stood out to me, I firstly enjoyed the comment about how all of our understanding
                 of the world is impartial, from this I understood that from this partialness comes all the interpretations and assumptions
                  that rule the world. Next, I thought it was interesting how the author outlined the differences between mental and computer models, 
                  the one that stood out most to be being the idea that mental models include "rich stores of information... such as motivations," 
                  whereas computer models don't. I'm not quite sure I completely agree, as (like we discussed a few classes back) the algorithms with 
                  which these computers are made are heavily biased. I realize then, that perhaps the problem with algorithmic bias is not 
                  necessarily that they exist (because they can't be 100% eliminated), but that we fail to notice them under the façade of computer precision.
